        <p>Hello There! :)</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            We are 4 UJ Students that want to make a difference in this technological world. We have designed a fully functioning website that allows users to 
            buy specific articles and magazines that they wish to spend money on. We pride ourselves in making the user's experience as healthy as possible.
            If you are a subscribed user you may want to help us grow by telling us what you want us to change or make your experience here better than ever before.
        </p>
